	  <h1>How I got Started</h1>
	  <ul>
		  <p>I have loved swimming since I was little. At the age of 4 I got started with a beginning swim lesson and found that I loved being in the water. After watching my brother that I looked up to, doing swim lessons I wanted to follow in his footsteps and I quickly started to have a love for swimming and began to enjoy being in the water as much as I could. Since the age of 4 I have contiuned to swim through various swim courses and classes. I started to swim for the Skyline's Swim club in 2019 at the age of 9 and joined their swimteam in 2024 at the age of 14. Since then I have contiuned to swim and just this past summer I got hired to become a swim instructor for kids.</p>
